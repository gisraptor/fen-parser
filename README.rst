      FEN Parser
######################

Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN) is a standard notation for describing a
particular board position of a chess game. The purpose of FEN is to provide
all the necessary information to restart a game from a particular position.[*]_

This project is a FEN position parser. It will have the ability to parse and
display a FEN position and eventually to take in a move as noted in algebraic
notation and render the new FEN string.
